We have uploaded few examples and slides of our talk. Few examples are still
left to be uplaoded. We'll be hosting everything on our github repositories. The
links are:

You will find Siddhant's example on his website.

Examples right now will compile without problem on *nix systems and I'm pretty
sure that it'll work with Microsoft Windows as well. Once I get access to a
machine with Windows, I'll upload makefiles that will work there. FYI I wont
upload MSVC Project files :P

simple-plugin example in C examples is written in C++ and Qt Frameworks. FYI
implementation is very naive. Its just a simple demo on what you can do with
that, so need to think on that part. 

Many examples are modified versions of Python documentation examples. Its highly
recommended that you go through them as well.
